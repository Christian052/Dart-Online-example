# Conditional Statements in Programming

Conditional statements allow a program to execute different actions based on certain conditions.

## 1. If Statement
- Executes a block of code **only if a specified condition is true**.
- If the condition is false, the code inside the block is skipped.

## 2. If-Else Statement
- Checks a condition:
  - **If true** → executes the first block of code.
  - **If false** → executes the alternative block.
- Ensures that one of the two blocks always runs.

## 3. Else-If Statement
- Allows **multiple conditions to be checked in sequence**.
- Executes the block corresponding to the **first true condition** and skips the rest.
- Useful when there are several possible outcomes.

## 4. Switch Statement
- Compares a single value against **multiple predefined cases**.
- Executes the block corresponding to the matching case.
- If no case matches, a **default block** can run.
- Cleaner than multiple if-else-if statements when checking one variable against many options.

## 5. Ternary Operator
- A **compact form of if-else** for simple conditions.
- Returns one value if the condition is true, another if false.
- Ideal for assigning values based on a single condition quickly.
